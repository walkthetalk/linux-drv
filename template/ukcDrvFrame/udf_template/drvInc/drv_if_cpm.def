 * TODO: add your own interface above this line, please ensure new interface
 * located at the end of all interfaces. (for product update/upgrade)
 * NOTE:
 *     it's best to write a subfix at the end of the name of interfaces to
 *     represent the card type, e.g. the subfix can be *cpm_fn*, in which
 *     the *cpm* represents the card type, *fn* represents a function.
 *     the same reason, for the 3rd argument of the macro, the name should
 *     also has some identification to represents card type; the example
 *     in here has a prefix *cpm_*, whose mean is same as the function
 *     name.
 * NOTE:
 *     don't bother of the use of macro, I know there will be some difficult
 *     to read the code, the macro here is for code-autogeneration, e.g.
 *     in user space, all interfaces will be convert to ioctl call, and
 *     in kernel space, the *ioctl* will be dispatch to all interfaces.
